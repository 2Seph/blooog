upon trying to bring my 'giforecast' idea to life, i rant into a lot of trouble and confusion, youtube videos were not a lot of help. so now, thanks to a 'how to get started with backend' post on reddit, i'm gonna try and learn from the ground up with fullstackopen.com/en. comments also mentioned that taking up computer science will put you on the right track to learning design architecture and network stuff anyway. but, i'm impatient, and i have the **audacity** to dive into this magical backend stuff. i'll be using this post for my notes. fuck python, fuck everyone. let's fucking go (pt.2)
