so i decided to take my own advice today from the article "audacity & whimsy," and so with as much audacity and whimsy as i can i am going try and create a web app (never mind the fact i barely remember any of the things i learned about javascript in the odin project..) called Giforecast, that allows users to enter a location, get weather info and a corresponding gif that matches the mood of that weather. let's fucking go.

<h2>First attempt</h2>
With chatgpt's guidance I decided on using completely foreign magic stack that is: vue, tailwind, express & node.js for backend, weather and gif APIs, and a backend hosting called heroku with netlify for front end hosting which i'm familiar-ish with.

so i start this project with how i started <i>this</i> blog project, which was by watching a couple of videos on the technologies neededâ€¦ my attention span allowed only a few fireship videos then I went to searching about on google and reddit. I ran into some good explanations of what backend is.

"The backend is the same thing as the frontend in terms of it simply being other software, except the software is running on a **server (a computer)** instead of in someone's browser. Its responsibility is typically to be the **middleman between the front end and a database.** FE asks BE a question, BE asks the DB for that info, DB gives BE raw data, BE packages it up nicely and sends the answer back to the FE."
