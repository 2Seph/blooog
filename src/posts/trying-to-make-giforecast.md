so i decided to take my own advice today from the article "audacity & whimsy," and with as much audacity and whimsy as i can i am going try and create a web app (never mind the fact i barely remember any of the things i learned about javascript in the odin project..) called Giforecast, that allows users to enter a location, get weather info and a corresponding gif that matches the mood of that weather. let's fucking go.

<h2>First attempt</h2>
With chatgpt's guidance I decided I'll be using foreign magic stack that includes: vue, tailwind, express & node.js for backend, weather and gif APIs, and a backend hosting called heroku with netlify for front end hosting which i'm familiar-ish with.

so i start this project with how i started this blog project, which was by watching videos on a couple of these technologies..
