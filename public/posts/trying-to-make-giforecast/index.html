            <h4>Jan 11, 2025</h4>
        <p>so i decided to take my own advice today from the article &quot;audacity &amp; whimsy,&quot; and so with as much audacity and whimsy as i can i am going try and create a web app (never mind the fact i barely remember any of the things i learned about javascript in the odin project..) called Giforecast, that allows users to enter a location, get weather info and a corresponding gif that matches the mood of that weather. let's fucking go.</p>

<h2>First attempt</h2>
With chatgpt's guidance I decided on using completely foreign magic stack that is: vue, tailwind, express & node.js for backend, weather and gif APIs, and a backend hosting called heroku with netlify for front end hosting which i'm familiar-ish with.
<p>so i start this project with how i started <i>this</i> blog project, which was by watching a couple of videos on the technologies neededâ€¦ my attention span allowed only a few fireship videos then I went to searching about on google and reddit. I ran into some good explanations of what backend is.</p>
<p>&quot;The backend is the same thing as the frontend in terms of it simply being other software, except the software is running on a <strong>server (a computer)</strong> instead of in someone's browser. Its responsibility is typically to be the <strong>middleman between the front end and a database.</strong> FE asks BE a question, BE asks the DB for that info, DB gives BE raw data, BE packages it up nicely and sends the answer back to the FE.&quot;</p>
