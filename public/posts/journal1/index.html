            <h2>audacity &amp; whimsy</h2>
            <h4>Jan 10, 2025</h4>
        <p>I used to be a pretty positive and bright person, anyone who knew me prior to the pandemic can tell you that much. But too much internet during the lockdowns changed that. Over the past few years, misanthropy and pessimism has become second nature for me  (thanks to covid lockdown, my predisposition to addiction and a certain type of home environment..). However, I've realized long ago that reality strongly supports a positive mindset rather than a negative one, which is why I'm hoping to break the habit of being swayed by negativity so easily this year.</p>
<p>In this post I interchange the word positivity and optimism quite a bit, in the end, what I'm generally getting at is: whimsy.</p>

<h2>Definition</h2>
<p><i>&quot;A pessimist sees the difficulty in every opportunity; an optimist sees the opportunity in every difficulty.&quot; -Winston Churchill</i></p>
<p>Optimisim can generally be defined as the belief that outcomes will be positive. Or, in short, optimists are those who believes that:</p>
<h3>
1. bad stuff won't last forever</h3> <h3>
2. it isn't the end of the world</h3><h3>
3. and it isn't entirely your fault</h3>
<p>Such a perspective allows optimists to more easily see the possibility for change.</p>
<h2>Can being overly optimistic be harmful?</h2>
<p>The obvious answer is, yes. The tendency to overestimate the likelihood of positive outcomes and downplay the likelihood of negative ones is called optimism bias.</p>
<p><i>While an optimistic viewpoint can help motivate people to take chances, a dose of realism about the risks involved can make success more likely.</i></p>
<p>Toxic positivity is an aversion to any negativity or citicism, and it turns hostile toward anything less than &quot;good vibes only.&quot; Like &quot;others have it worse,&quot; or, &quot;being depressed is a choice.&quot;</p>
<p>Optimism is more about &quot;can's&quot;, while toxic positivity is more about &quot;should's.&quot; Optimisim is genuine, comes naturally, allows unpleasant feelings. While toxic positivity is a flimsy bandaid towards one's suffering.</p>
<p>Forcing one's self to just 'think-positive' is basically toxic positivity or spiritual bypassing (the use of one's spirituality to avoid the hard work of processing emotional pain). True positivity is far more powerful when coupled with the effort of understanding the root causes of negative thoughts, rather than simply trying to ignore them.</p>
<p>For example, when feeling offended, rather than just pushing it away, sitting with that feeling and fully processing it can help you slowly release the grip it has on you. Sure, you’ll likely have to face more ego-puncturing moments along the way for it to feel like water off a duck's back, but each time you work through it and surround yourself with things that genuinely make you happy—like how, for me, watching boynextdoor, especially Leehan, or watching stupid memes on tiktok brings comfort - it’s in those moments of self-reflection and joy that you’re more likely to develop a genuine &quot;I can do it&quot; mindset.</p>
<p>Adding to that, it's easy to fall into the trap of applying a 'one-size-fits-all' philosophy when sitting with a negative experience, but this ignores the nuances of reality. On the flip side, if you approach life with overly positive expectations, you might end up glossing over problems that need your attention.</p>
<p>The key is to be realistic, and by realistic that doesn't mean negative. A lot of people default to negative expectations even when there's no real reason to and unintentionally shoot themselves in the foot before the situation even gets the chance to.</p>
<p>As always, there's a balance.</p>
<h2>Happiness can be hard</h2>
<p>For some of us, positivity requires more effort. It could be due to whatever reason, in my case, too much internet. Whatever mindset people have practiced longer is the path of least resistance. Everyone's life is different, as are our brain chemistries. And things like depression or anxiety make it all the harder.</p>
<p>If life is going great it's obviously easer to be positive, like trekking through calm waters. But when life is hard, you have to make the conscious decision to be positive. And making the conscious decision to change an ingrained habit that has become automatic and has formed neural pathways in one's brain requires some pretty monumental effort.</p>

<p>And it's okay for humans to go through rough patches. It's okay to not be positive 100% of the time, humans aren't built to be upbeat 24/7.</p>
<h2>So why choose optimism?</h2>
<p>When you approach problems, people, or any situation with a positive mindset, you are far more likely to come out with a solution, a friend or a good outcome. Positive mindset attracts other positive people (whom are far more enjoyable).</p>

<p>There is also this thing called observer effect, which to summarize is where attention goes, energy grows. If we focus more on the negative than the positive, we amplify the negative aspects of the experience. By focusing on our emotions rather than the objective reality, we give those emotions more power, we let them control us. Making challenges feel insurmountable and setbacks feel much bigger than they are.</p>
<p>On the other hand if we consciously direct our attention to even the small positives - like what we can learn from this, the progress we've made, it can shift our perspective if even just a bit. This doesn't dismiss the difficulties we face but it can reframe them as part of a <em>bigger picture</em></p>
<p>Then there is the reticular activating system, if i start thinking about buying a red car, i'll suddenly notice red cars everywhere i go. this doesn't mean there are more red cars than before - it's just that my brain is now tuned to look for them. If your focus shift you will pay more attention to that thing and see it pop up more. For example, if I were focused on being more like leehan, or even woonhak, I'll start noticing situations where I can practice the traits they embody in my own life.</p>
<p>Bonus info:</p>
<ul>
<li>if you are calm and at peace, that is your intuition talking. Anything else is ego, outside forces, etc. An extreme example is 'flow state.' When people are in this state they feel like they have all the time in the world.</li>
<li>when feeling blocked on a question, make sure your &quot;energy is up.&quot; Meaning get happy. Do something that lifts your spirits, doesn't matter what as long as it is authentic to you. Then allow yourself to go back to being calm, then ask your question and be patient. The answer may not come immediately. In which case enjoy the calm for however you like and move through your day with eyes, ears, and gut open to any signals you might get</li>
</ul>

<p>Dear me,</p>
<p>As you set your goal this year to learn at least 4 new tech stacks and build projects that you can use regularly, remember that the key is approaching this goal with a mindset of seeing difficulties as opportunities rather than roadblocks.</p>
<p>If you shift your attention towards the solutions or your learning moments in coding, you'll be able to see the value in the process itself in no time, rather than just focusing on the final outcome.</p>
<p>And when things get really tough - which they will - remind yourself that <em>humans are genuinely not hardwired to be upbeat all the time.</em> Instead, give yourself room to be realistic - acknowledge the struggle, but reframe it as part of the bigger picture. For example, you struggled linking this site to a CMS, you took a long break, watched some boynextdoor videos and lost yourself in the sauce a little, slept, woke up with a fresh perspective. It took patience, but you figured it out on your own.</p>
<p>In the long run, the more you focus on growth instead of perfection, the more you'll find that your skills improve naturally. Oh, and don’t forget to dive in with audacity - the same mindset that got you started with this site. Trust that it'll pay off.</p>
<p>By consciously choosing to be positive (ahem, whimsical) <em>and</em> respecting the balance. You'll be able to come out stronger on the other side. All the best of luck to you.</p>
<p>With optimism and patience,</p>
<p>Me.</p>
